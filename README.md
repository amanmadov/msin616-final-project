</div>

<br/>

This is a simple database that can be used to maintain the data stored and processed by a **lending library**. 
The database has been designed by modifying Microsoft's `Pubs` database.
The `Pubs` database provides a set of fictional pieces of information about **publishers**, **authors**, **titles** and **sales** of books.
It is now considered **obsolete**; it is no longer provided with `SQL Server` since the **2008 version**.
The tables and fields are quite obvious. 
They have names such as `Authors`, `Titles`, etc., which reflect their content. 
And the fields also have obvious names explaining what they contain.

<p>
  You can find the details about original Pubs DB in the link:
  <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs" target="_blank">Microsoft Pubs DB</a>
</p>

Below you can see the altered database diagram of the `Pubs` database

## Technologies Used
 - **`Microsoft SQL Server 2019`** - 15.0.4198.2 Developer Edition (64-bit) on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS)
 - **`Azure Data Studio`** version 1.35.1
 - **`Docker`** version 4.4.2 (73305)

<br/>

## Modifications on the Database

- [x] To simulate a real world full stack app, a demo **CRUD** app with front-end UI has been developed.
- [x] `Gentellela`, an open source admin panel, has been used to create front-end UI.
- [x] Stored procedures are created for the demo **CRUD** app.
- [x] Some custom validations has been developed on the Front-end UI to prevent data inconsistency.
- [x] Almost all stored procedures for creating/modifying records are created based on the front-end validations.
- [x] `[TITLES]` table have been altered and **prequel_id** column have been added to store the prequel of a book.
- [x] Using prequel books, recursive queries can be written and executed on the `[TITLES]` table.
- [x] `[TITLES]` table have been altered and **ISBN** column have been added.
- [x] Some famous book series like **"A Game of Thrones"** or **"The Lord of The Rings"** are added to the `[TITLES]` table.
- [x] Some famous author and publisher records are added to related tables.
- [x] Some of the **column types** are also modified.
- [x] Created `[Audit].[Book]` table to keep audit history of the created books.
- [x] Used `[Adventureworks].[Person].[Person]` and `[AdventureWorks].[HumanResources].[Employee]` tables to generate dummy data.
- [x] `Jobs` table has been dropped 
- [X] `Roysched` table has been dropped 
- [x] `Employees` table has been altered
- [x] `Employee_type` table has been created
- [x] `Category` table has been created 
- [x] `TitleCategory` table has been created 
- [x] `Degrees` table has been created
- [x] `Schools` table has been created
- [x] `Branchs` table has been created
- [x] `Shift_logs` table has been created
- [x] `Paychecks` table has been created
- [x] `Borrowers` table has been created
- [x] `Bookcopies` table has been created
- [x] `Bookcopy_history` table has been created
- [x] `Books_borrowed` table has been created
- [x] Created user defined functions and views to generate and insert **dummy data** to database.
- [x] Created triggers to **prevent data inconsistency**.

`[dbo].[USP_InsertBook]` stored procedure is a bit complex because it does not create just a book. If there is no publisher or author associated with that new book, it also helps user to create them. Thats why `@pub_id` and `@author_id` parameters of `[dbo].[USP_InsertBook]` stored procedure are optional.
If user selects an existing publisher or author from the dropdown menu element on the front-end app, selected value of the selected option, as an in the form of `@pub_id` or `@author_id`, is passed to the stored procedure. If an author or publisher for the new book is not found on the dropdown menu (or database) an app makes it easy to create them. Using the **last options** `Create New Author...` and `Create New Publisher...` on the dropdown menu, a user can create a new author or a publisher. Also a book may have prequel or not. So considering all these, there a 4 possible scenarios of creating a book.

Note: Dropdown menu items are populated with the existing authors and publishers in a database.

<br/>

These Test Cases are:
<br/>

```diff

+ Create Book for Existing Author and Existing Publisher
+ Create Book for Existing Author and Non-Existent Publisher
+ Create Book for Non-Existent Author and Existing Publisher
+ Create Book for Non-Existent Author and Non-Existent Publisher

```

<br/> 
Now lets test each of these test cases.

### II. Creating an Author on the Demo App

<br/>

<p>Link for the front-end ui module:<a href="https://amanmadov.github.io/msin616-final-project/production/create_author.html" target="_blank"> View Demo</a></p>

<br/>

Stored procedure for adding an author into the `Authors` table

<br/>

```sql
/*
    Created by Nury Amanmadov
    Date created: 17.04.2022
*/

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[USP_CreateAuthor]
     @au_lname VARCHAR(40)
    ,@au_fname VARCHAR(20)
    ,@au_phone CHAR(12) = '000 000-0000'
    ,@au_address VARCHAR(250) = NULL
    ,@au_city VARCHAR(20) = NULL
    ,@au_state CHAR(2) = NULL
    ,@au_zip CHAR(5) = NULL
    ,@au_contract BIT = 0
AS
BEGIN
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Generate Random AuthorID 
        DECLARE @au_id dbo.tid 
        SET @au_id = dbo.fn_GenerateRandomAuthorId(RAND())

        INSERT INTO authors 
        VALUES
        (
             @au_id
            ,@au_lname
            ,@au_fname
            ,@au_phone
            ,@au_address
            ,@au_city
            ,@au_state
            ,@au_zip
            ,@au_contract
        ) 
    END TRY 
    BEGIN CATCH
        PRINT('An Error Occured During The Transaction. Error SP: ' + ERROR_PROCEDURE() + 'Error line: ' + CAST(ERROR_LINE() AS VARCHAR))
        PRINT(ERROR_MESSAGE())
    END CATCH 
END
```
<br/>

Since creating an `author_id` is used in multiple stored procedures, I created a function that creates `author_id`.
<br/>

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[fn_GenerateRandomAuthorId](
    @RAND FLOAT 
)
RETURNS VARCHAR(11) AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @author_id VARCHAR(11)
    DECLARE @isFound BIT = 0
    WHILE (@isFound = 0)
        BEGIN
            DECLARE @a1 AS CHAR(3) = (SELECT(CAST((FLOOR(@RAND*(999-100+1)+100)) AS CHAR)))
            DECLARE @a2 AS CHAR(2) = (SELECT(CAST((FLOOR(@RAND*(99-10+1)+10)) AS CHAR)))
            DECLARE @a3 AS CHAR(4) = (SELECT(CAST((FLOOR(@RAND*(9999-1000+1)+1000)) AS CHAR)))
            SET @author_id = (SELECT @a1 + '-' + @a2 + '-' + @a3)
            IF EXISTS(SELECT TOP 1 1 FROM [authors] WHERE au_id = @author_id)
                BEGIN
                    CONTINUE
                END
            ELSE 
                BEGIN
                    SET @isFound = 1
                END
        END
    RETURN @author_id
END;
```
<br/>

<br/>

Stored procedure for adding a `CoAuthor`. If coauthor does not exist on the dropdown menu we can create a new author and add it.

<br/>

<br/>

Here at the front-end side, I developed some logic with javascript to simulate the stored procedure functionality. 
This is a `Recursive` stored procedure for getting prequel book or books for a specific book in a series. Used `CTE` inside the query.

<br/>

```sql
/*
    Created by Nury Amanmadov
    Date created: 17.04.2022 ddMMyyyy

    Selects all the prequel book series of a given book

*/

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[USP_GetAllPrequelBooksByTitleId]
    @title_id dbo.tid
AS 
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT TOP 1 1 FROM titles WHERE title_id = @title_id)
        BEGIN 
            ;THROW 50001, 'Book with provided ID does not exist', 1
        END
    ;WITH CTEBooks
    AS 
    (
        SELECT   title_id AS TitleId
                ,title AS Book
                ,prequel_id
                ,CAST(t1.pubdate AS DATE) AS [Publication Date]
                ,p.pub_name AS Publisher
        FROM titles t1
        JOIN publishers p ON p.pub_id = t1.pub_id
        WHERE title_id = @title_id

        UNION ALL

        SELECT   t2.title_id AS TitleId
                ,t2.title AS Book
                ,t2.prequel_id
                ,CAST(t2.pubdate AS DATE) AS [Publication Date]
                ,p.pub_name AS Publisher
        FROM titles t2
        JOIN publishers p ON p.pub_id = t2.pub_id
        JOIN CTEBooks ON t2.title_id = CTEBooks.prequel_id
    )
    SELECT  CTEBooks.TitleId 
            ,CTEBooks.Book
            ,ISNULL(t.title, 'No Prequel') AS PrequelBook
            ,[Publication Date]
            ,a.au_fname + ' ' + a.au_lname AS Author
            ,CTEBooks.Publisher
    FROM CTEBooks
    LEFT JOIN titles t ON CTEBooks.prequel_id = t.title_id
    LEFT JOIN titleauthor ta ON ta.title_id = CTEBooks.TitleId
    LEFT JOIN authors a ON a.au_id = ta.au_id
END
```

<br/>

Now if we execute this stored procedure with a `title_id` of a continuing book in a series we will get the **prequel books** of that book.

<br/>

```sql
-- For 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' in the 'Harry Potter' Series
EXEC USP_GetAllPrequelBooksByTitleId @title_id = 'GU4539'
```
<br/>
<img src="https://github.com/amanmadov/msin616-final-project/blob/main/custom-images/harry-potter.png">
<br/>


```sql
-- For 'The Return of the King' in the 'Lord of the Rings' Series
EXEC USP_GetAllPrequelBooksByTitleId @title_id = 'ZJ4675' 
```

<br/>
<img src="https://github.com/amanmadov/msin616-final-project/blob/main/custom-images/lotr.png">

### IX. Listing Continuing Books in s Book Series

<br/>

```sql

/*
    Created by Nury Amanmadov

*/

CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[USP_GetAllContinuingBooksByTitleId]
    @title_id dbo.tid
AS 
BEGIN 
    IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT TOP 1 1 FROM titles WHERE title_id = @title_id)
        BEGIN 
	    ;THROW 50001, 'Book with provided ID does not exist', 1
        END

    ;WITH CTEBooks
    AS 
    (
        SELECT   title_id AS TitleId
                ,title AS Book
                ,prequel_id
                ,CAST(t1.pubdate AS DATE) AS [Publication Date]
                ,p.pub_name AS Publisher
                ,[Order In Series] = 1
        FROM titles t1
        JOIN publishers p ON p.pub_id = t1.pub_id
        WHERE title_id = @title_id

        UNION ALL

        SELECT   t2.title_id AS TitleId
                ,t2.title AS Book
                ,t2.prequel_id
                ,CAST(t2.pubdate AS DATE) AS [Publication Date]
                ,p.pub_name AS Publisher
                ,[Order In Series] + 1
        FROM titles t2
        JOIN publishers p ON p.pub_id = t2.pub_id
        JOIN CTEBooks ON t2.prequel_id = CTEBooks.TitleId
    )
    SELECT  CTEBooks.TitleId 
            ,CTEBooks.Book
            ,ISNULL(t.title, 'No Prequel') AS PrequelBook
            ,[Publication Date]
            ,a.au_fname + ' ' + a.au_lname AS Author
            ,CTEBooks.Publisher
            ,[Order In Series]
    FROM CTEBooks
    LEFT JOIN titles t ON CTEBooks.prequel_id = t.title_id
    LEFT JOIN titleauthor ta ON ta.title_id = CTEBooks.TitleId
    LEFT JOIN authors a ON a.au_id = ta.au_id
END
```
<br/>

Now if we execute this stored procedure with an `title_id` of a book in a series we will get the **continuing books** of that series.

<br/>

```sql
-- For 'The Lord of the Rings' Series
EXEC [dbo].[USP_GetAllContinuingBooksByTitleId] 'EX5727'

### X. Delete a Book from Titles table

### I. Creating a Borrower on the database

<br/>

The library issues library cards to people who wish to borrow books from the library. The library keeps a list of each borrower by storing the `card id` , `borrower name` , `address` , `phone number` , `birthdate` , `date the card was issued` and `balance due` . A card expires **ten years** from the time it is issued.
If a person is **less than 18 years old**, then the library will also keep information about the Borrower’s parent or legal guardian such as `name` , `address` and `phone number` .
A person can have only **one valid library card** at a given time.
A person **can’t be issued a new library card**, if he **owes money on an expired card**.

<br/>

```sql 
/*

Rules for creating a card for borrower
    - A person can have only one valid library card at a given time.
    - A person can’t be issued a new library card, if he owes money on an expired card.
    - a person can not be younger than 10.

### II. Borrowing and returning a book operation on the database

<br/>

For each borrowed book copy, the library keeps track of the `copy id` and the `card number` of the person who borrowed it. The library keeps track of the `date on which it was borrowed` and records the due date which is **two weeks** after the borrow date. When the copy is returned this record is **updated** with the `return date` .
When a book copy is borrowed, the copy is marked as `BORROWED` . When the book copy is returned the copy is marked as `AVAILABLE` or `NOT BORROWED` .
A borrower can’t borrow a book from a particular branch unless that branch has a copy of that book and it is **currently in stock** (e.g. not being borrowed by someone else)
When a borrower returns a book copy **after the due date** the system calculates the `amount owed` and any overdue charge incurred is added to the `card balance` .
A borrower can not use a card to borrow books, if he owes **more than 10 dollars** on that card.
The library has a list of overdue charges. The charges are currently **.05** each day for **juvenile** books and **.10** per day for adult books. When a book is returned **late** the borrower pays charges that are in effect at the time the book is returned.
Any reading item that is categorized as `reference` may **not** be borrowed.

Stored procedure for **borrowing** operation

```sql
/*

    Rules for borrowing a book:
    - Any reading item that is categorized as reference may not be borrowed.
    - Copies that are in POOR condition may not be borrowed.
    - When a book copy is borrowed, the copy is marked as BORROWED. BORROWED copies may not be borrowed.
    - A borrower can not use a card to borrow books, if he owes more than 10 dollars on that card.

<br/>

### III. Discarding books on the database

<br/>

The Library assigns a `Condition` to each book copy. Sample condition values could be `NEW` , `EXCELLENT` , `GOOD` , `WORN` and `POOR`. Eventually copies that are in `POOR` condition will be discarded and replaced with new copies.
A borrower can acknowledge that he has lost a copy of a book. If so, the copy is marked `LOST` and the book’s cost is added to the card balance. Eventually the copy may be removed from the current inventory of branch copies and stored in a history file.

Added CHECK CONSTRAINT on `Bookcopies` table for the condition column

```sql
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[bookcopies]  WITH CHECK ADD  CONSTRAINT [CK__bookcopie__condi__09746778] 
CHECK(([condition]='NEW' OR [condition]='EXCELLENT' OR [condition]='GOOD' OR [condition]='WORN' OR [condition]='POOR' OR [condition]='LOST'))
```

Stored procedure for discarding book in `POOR` condition 

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[USP_DiscardBook]

AS 
BEGIN 
    -- Check if copy_id is valid
    IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT TOP 1 1 FROM bookcopies WHERE copy_id = @copy_id)

### IV. Employee restrictions on the database

<br/>

There are several branches within this lending library system. For each branch store the `branch id` , `name` , `address` , `telephone number` , `fax number` , `head librarian` . A branch might employ several librarians, but **only one head librarian**. For each librarian, store the `employee id` , `name` , `address` , `telephone number` , `salary` and `cell phone number` . A librarian may be assigned to **only one** branch. Branches have different types of employees. Some types are : `Librarian` , `Network Administrator` , `Computer Programmer` , `IT Manager` , `Floor Manager` , `Custodian` , `Accountant` , `Data Analyst` . 
Librarians **must have earned** a degree in library science. 
For each employee, the library maintains `name` , `address` , `phone number` , `birthdate` , `hire date` and `type of employee` . 
For librarians, the library also maintains **when the librarian earned his/her degree** and **the school at which the librarian earned the degree**
The Library supports two types of PayTypes: `salaried` and `hourly` . Employees that are salaried earn a yearly salary that is paid in **12 payments on the first of each month**. Employees that are clerical, earn **an hourly wage**. 
All employees get `vacation time` depending on their **length of service**. The minimum amount of vacation time is **two weeks**.
The library maintains a **log of how many hours each clerical type of employee logged during each week that he worked**. This log is used to produce `paychecks` for **clerical staff** at the end of each week.
Librarians earn between **20000 and 70000** per year. Pay rate for hourly workers must be at least **15.00**. A librarian can’t be hired before he has earned a **MS in Library Science** degree.
