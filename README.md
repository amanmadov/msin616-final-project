<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is the simple database designed using Microsoft's Pubs Database.
The Pubs database provides a set of fictional pieces of information about publishers, authors, titles and sales of books.
It is now considered obsolete; it is no longer provided with SQL Server since the 2008 version.
The tables and fields are quite obvious. 
They have names such as Authors, Titles, etc., which reflect their content. 
And the fields also have obvious names explaining what they contain.

<p>
  You can find the details about original Pubs DB in the link:

</p>

Below you can see the altered database diagram of the Pubs database
